               <h2>ENEMY</h2>
               <pre> 
                    Look out for yourself
                    
                    I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
                    For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
                    I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
                    When my back is to the world, that was smiling when I turned
                    Tell you you're the greatest
                    But once you turn they hate us
                    
                    Oh, the misery
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    Spare the sympathy
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    Look out for yourself
                    My enemy
                    Look out for yourself
                    But I'm ready
                    
                    Your words up on the wall, as you're praying for my fall
                    And the laughter in the halls, and the names that I've been called
                    I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
                    When I show you what it's like, to be words spit in a mic
                    Tell you you're the greatest
                    But once you turn they hate us
                    
                    Oh, the misery
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    Smell the sympathy
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    Look out for yourself
                    My enemy
                    Look, look, look, look, look out for yourself
                    
                    _JID verse_
                    
                    Yeah
                    Uh, look, okay
                    I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
                    I'm praying that somebody hope for me
                    I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
                    P-p-posted
                    Being a wreck of emotions
                    Ready to go whenever just let me know
                    The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
                    The enemy's on my trail
                    My energy unavailable
                    Imma tell 'em hasta luego
                    They wanna plot on my trot to the top
                    I've been outta shape
                    Thinkin' out the box
                    I'm an astronaut
                    I blasted off the planet rock to cause Catastrophe and it matters, more because I had it not,
                    Had I  thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
                    Kinda shockin' they wanted static 
                    With precision I'm automatic quarterback
                    I ain't talkin' sacking
                    Pack it pack it up
                    I don't panic
                    Batter batter up
                    Who the baddest
                    It don't matter
                    Cause we at ya throat
                    
                    __
                    
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    Spare the sympathy
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    Oh, the misery
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    Spare the sympathy
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy
                    
                    They say pray it away, I swear, I'll never be a Saint, no way
                    My enemy
                    They say pray it away, I swear, I'll never be a Saint
                    Look out for yourself
