               <h1>Lyrics</h1>
               <h2>ENEMY</h2>
               <pre> 
               Look out for yourself
                  
               I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
               For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
               I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
               When my back is to the world, that was smiling when I turned
               Tell you you're the greatest
               But once you turn they hate us
                   
               Oh, the misery
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               Spare the sympathy
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               Look out for yourself
               My enemy
               Look out for yourself
               But I'm ready
               
               Your words up on the wall, as you're praying for my fall
               And the laughter in the halls, and the names that I've been called
               I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
               When I show you what it's like, to be words spit in a mic
               Tell you you're the greatest
               But once you turn they hate us
               
               Oh, the misery
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               Smell the sympathy
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               Look out for yourself
               My enemy
               Look, look, look, look, look out for yourself
               
               _JID verse_
                    
               Yeah
               Uh, look, okay
               I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
               I'm praying that somebody hope for me
               I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
               P-p-posted
               Being a wreck of emotions
               Ready to go whenever just let me know
               The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
               The enemy's on my trail
               My energy unavailable
               Imma tell 'em hasta luego
               They wanna plot on my trot to the top
               I've been outta shape
               Thinkin' out the box
               I'm an astronaut
               I blasted off the planet rock to cause Catastrophe and it matters, more because I had it not,
               Had I  thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
               Kinda shockin' they wanted static 
               With precision I'm automatic quarterback
               I ain't talkin' sacking
               Pack it pack it up
               I don't panic
               Batter batter up
               Who the baddest
               It don't matter
               Cause we at ya throat
               
               __
               
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               Spare the sympathy
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               Oh, the misery
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               Spare the sympathy
               Everybody wants to be my enemy
               
               They say pray it away, I swear, I'll never be a Saint, no way
               My enemy
               They say pray it away, I swear, I'll never be a Saint
               Look out for yourself
