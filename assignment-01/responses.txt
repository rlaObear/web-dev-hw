1. I took this class because it is required for my degree, and I also would like to learn how to make a website, as I will need it as a platform for my work and to aid in getting hired in the future.

2. I am excited to learn how to build a website and want to learn tools to help me promote my future work and, one day, work in animation.

3. The image I uploaded is from my Spring 2023 MARTGDSN class, where I was required to create a self-portrait without using a picture of myself. I chose a Mustang covered in dirt as life has thrown me more than a few curve balls, and Mustangs are noted for their spirit and endurance. The Celtic tree of life and family symbolizes my heritage and family, as my family is always a priority. Lastly, a clock face, for as I learn to live with PTSD and its side effects, I find time can be my worst enemy.
