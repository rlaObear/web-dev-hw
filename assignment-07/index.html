      “Oh, Amelia Bedelia, your first day of work, and I can't be here.
       But I made a list for you. You do just what the list says,” said Mrs. Rogers. 
       Mrs. Rogers got into the car with Mr. Rogers. They drove away.
       "My, what nice folks. I'm going to like working here," said Amelia Bedelia.
       Amelia Bedelia went inside. “Such a grand house. 
       These must be rich folks. But I must get to work. Here I stand just looking. 
       And me with a whole list of things to do.” 
       Amelia Bedelia stood there a minute longer. 
       “I think I'll make a surprise for them. 
       I'll make lemon meringue pie. I do make good pies.”
