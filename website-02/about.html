        Coming from a humble background where further education beyond high school was never discussed, 
        I was still determining my life's path. 
        The notion of pursuing higher education like some of my friends, I believed financially out of reach. 
        As a result, I took odd jobs with no direction in my life for some time.
        One day, while my hairdresser was styling my hair, he noticed something and said, 
        "You have a natural knack for styling your hair that most do not. 
        Have you ever considered becoming a hairdresser? I actually just opened a barber college. 
        Would you be interested in attending?"
        
        I replied, "I never thought about it, but I don't have the money."
        
        He said, "What if I could help you get a grant?"
        
        Curious, I asked, "What's a grant?"
        
        He explained, "It's a program that covers the cost of your education."
        
        "So, I wouldn't have to pay anything?" I asked.
        
        "Exactly," he replied.
        
        "Well, sure, why not give it a try?" I said.
        
        After attending barber school, I got a job at my teacher Sheri's salon, which happened to be the most prestigious salon in my hometown. 
        I did quite well there, thanks to my natural talent for hair. 
        However, it was the late 80s and early 90s, and big hair was the trend. 
        My long, thin, but voluminous and naturally curly hair was perfect for those styles. 
        Almost everyone who sat in my chair wanted to replicate my hairdo. 
        The only challenge was when clients with thin straight hair and limited volume wanted the same style.
        After dealing with the crazy demands of people who wanted me to fix what the had done to their hair or make it look a certain way, 
        even if it was impossible given their hair type, beleaving I had a "Magic Wand."

        After a particularly frustrating customer wanting her money back, I found myself at lunch looking at the wanted ad's 
        in the newspaper. One of which read, "Be a Nanny in New York." 
        It took me all of about five minutes to say, "Why not?" 
        And three weeks later, I worked as a nanny in New York, from there, I went on to work as a nanny in Maryland. 
        
        It was during this time that I met someone who turned out to be the biggest mistake of my life!
        Or maybe not!
